## 🎯 CAPP Application

The **Canza Autonomous Payment Protocol (CAPP)** is the flagship application demonstrating the platform's capabilities:

### Features

* **End-to-End Payment Processing**: Complete payment flow from request to settlement
* **AI Agent Orchestration**: Intelligent agents coordinate payment optimization
* **Real-Time Optimization**: Route optimization and cost reduction
* **Multi-Currency Support**: 42+ African currencies
* **Blockchain Integration**: Aptos blockchain settlement
* **Mobile Money Integration**: USSD, SMS, and API connections
* **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and insights

### Architecture

* **Backend**: FastAPI-based REST API with async processing
* **Frontend**: React-based user interface with real-time updates
* **Agents**: Autonomous payment optimization agents
* **Database**: PostgreSQL with async SQLAlchemy
* **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and structured logging

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the backend
cd applications/capp
python -m capp.main

# Start the frontend (in another terminal)
cd applications/capp/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### API Endpoints

* `GET /health` - Health check
* `POST /api/v1/payments/send` - Send payment
* `GET /api/v1/payments/{payment_id}/status` - Payment status
* `GET /api/v1/payments/routes` - Available routes
* `GET /api/v1/payments/rates` - Exchange rates

## 🚀 Building New Applications

To build a new application using the Canza Platform:

1. **Create a new directory** in `applications/`
2. **Use the shared packages** from `packages/`
3. **Leverage the SDK** from `sdk/`
4. **Follow the established patterns** from CAPP
5. **Add comprehensive documentation**

### Example Structure

```
applications/my-app/
├── backend/               # Application backend
├── frontend/              # Application frontend
├── agents/                # Custom agents
├── tests/                 # Test suite
├── docs/                  # Documentation
